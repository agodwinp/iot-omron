## OMRON Sensor

- Use py3 python environment. Documentation says to use 2.7 but this does not work.
- BlueZ does not work properly on MacOS. This is because the `hciconfig' tools needed by BlueZ are only available on Linux.
- Therefore, to extract data from this sensor, need to run scripts and do work in Linux VM or machine.
